Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that creates new content, such as text, images, video, audio, and code, by learning patterns from existing data. It operates on neural networks and deep learning algorithms that can generate novel content in response to a user's natural language prompt. While it enhances productivity and offers numerous applications, it also presents risks like generating inaccurate information (hallucinations) and raises concerns about intellectual property and job displacement.
